  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Murgh Malai Tikkas are bite size pieces of chicken cooked in a creamy marinade with yoghurt, cheese, ginger, garlic
    and chilli. There is a balance of flavour from the creamy yoghurt along with the heat of the ground chilli paste and
    warmth from the garam masala powder. </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>550gms chicken thighs cut to bite size pieces</li>
    <li>1 tbsp malt vinegar</li>
    <li>4 garlic cloves ground to a paste</li>
    <li>1” ginger ground to a paste</li>
    <li>1 ½ tbsp Greek yoghurt</li>
    <li>50mls double cream</li>
    <li>1 heaped tsp corn flour</li>
    <li>25gms cheddar cheese grated</li>
    <li>1 tsp green chilli paste (add a bit less if you prefer less spicy)</li>
    <li>1 tsp finely chopped coriander leaves</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Melted butter for basting</li>
    <li>Pinch garam masala powder</li>
    <li>Pinch chaat masala powder or lime juice</li>
    <li>Green chutney and onion rings to serve</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Marinate the chicken in the vinegar, garlic and ginger paste for 15-20 minutes.
      In a separate bowl mix together the greek yoghurt, double cream with the corn flour well making sure there are no
      lumps. Now add the grated cheese and mix well. Add the chilli paste, chopped coriander and salt.
    </li>
    <li> Add this mix to the chicken and marinate 20 minutes or preferably overnight. </li>
    <li> Soak wooden skewers in water. Preheat the grill onto a high setting. Shake off the excess marinade and thread
      the chicken pieces onto the skewers. Place them on a wire rack on the top shelf. Cook under the grill for 12-15
      minutes. Baste with butter every 5 minutes and cook until the juices run clear and the chicken is cooked through
      slightly charred around the edges.</li>
    <li>Take the chicken off the skewers and rest them over roti or naan. Sprinkle with a pinch of garam masala powder
      and chaat masala. Serve with a green chutney and onion salad. </li>
